Description: the user enters via mouse with the control points of one Bezier curve and a line. 
The number of control points is arbitrary, without limit. 
The system should draw the figures, curve and line, and present the interpolation parameter values 
where the line intercepts the Bezier Curve.
The approximation intersection method is the subdivision. 
The user can move, insert and delete points, with the system responding appropriately in real time. 
The approximation tolerance is adjustable by the user. Assessments should be made compulsory with the De Casteljau algorithm.
